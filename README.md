# Joytime Input HIDAPI
[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fswitch-joytime%2Fjoytime-input-hidapi.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fswitch-joytime%2Fjoytime-input-hidapi?ref=badge_shield)


Joytime is a library for writing programs that use the Switch's controllers
(i.e. the JoyCons and the Pro Controller) with PCs (or any other platform Joytime
compiles on). Joytime Input HIDAPI is an input library for Joytime, handling communication between
the controllers and Joytime Core. It implements everything in C++, but it also comes with a C
wrapper for C clients.

Right now, it works and has been tested on Windows 10 with VS 2017. It should
compile and work on other platforms, though. If anyone would like to be a guinea
pig and test it, go right ahead! It'd be great to get some feedback.

# TODO

  * Write a demo program
  * Write some documentation on how to use the library
